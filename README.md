## **What**

### User Stories
As a disorganised person I want to:

+ enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them.
+ view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day.
+ mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left.
+ the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb.

### Stretch Goals
+ enable editing of todo list
+ order function (name/date)
+ make it look beautiful with CSS
+ time limit with alert

## **How**

This is how we will split up the tasks to complete the todo app.

### Part 1

+ Create new repository with readme and copied skeleton files.
+ As a group read through the skeleton files and try our best to understand the code.
+ Create the three pure functions using TDD
  - addTodo
  - markTodo
  - deleteTodo
+ ensure all tests pass
+ ensure all members of the team understand the code

### Part 2

+ Create the app using the functions made in part one
+ Make a new function createTodoNode

### Rules

+ camelCase for class names and variables
+ indentation one tab (two spaces)
+ always pair programming, using ping pong when doing TDD
